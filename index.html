            Now that you’ve set up your computer with all the tools you’ll need,
            it’s time to get started!
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the course of this Tutorial, you’ll build and deploy your first
            Gatsby site: a blog site with support for images and MDX! (If that
            doesn’t mean anything to you now, that’s okay! It will by the time
            you reach the end.) Here’s a
            <a href="https://introworkshopexamplesitev3.gatsbyjs.io/"
              >finished example</a
            >
            of the site you’ll build.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this part of the Tutorial, you will go through the process of
            creating the template for your blog site and deploying it online for
            everyone to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diagram below shows a high-level view of how all the pieces of
            this process fit together. (Don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense
            yet. You’ll learn about each step as you go.)

              First, you write the code for your Gatsby site from your computer.
              When you’re ready to make your changes live on the internet, you
              go through the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                You push your changes from your computer to a remote repository
                on GitHub. GitHub is an online platform for storing code for
                your projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gatsby Cloud watches your GitHub repository for changes. When it
                sees your new changes, Gatsby Cloud builds your site from your
                code on GitHub.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gatsby Cloud hosts the finished version of your site at a unique
                URL, which users can use to access the latest version of your
                site.
              </li>
            </ol>

          <p>
            To create your first Gatsby site, you’re going to use a command from
            the Gatsby command line interface (CLI): gatsby new. This command
            brings up an interactive prompt that asks you questions about the
            site you want to build. After you enter all the information, the CLI
            uses your answers to automatically generate your new Gatsby site.
          </p>

          <notes class="nc">
            <summary><strong>Note : </strong></summary>
            <p>
              For this Tutorial, your Gatsby CLI should be v3 or newer. To check
              what version you have installed, run the following command:
              <code>gatsby --version</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Need to update? Run the command below to get the latest version of
              the Gatsby CLI: <code>npm install -g gatsby-cli</code>
            </p>
          </notes>
          <p>Let’s take a closer look at the process:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Open the command line, and use the cd command to change
                directories into the folder where you want to create your new
                Gatsby site. For example, if you wanted to create your new site
                on your desktop, you might type:
                <code>cd Desktop</code>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Run the following command from the command line. This will start
                up the interactive prompt to help you create a new Gatsby site.
                <code>gatsby new</code>
              </p>
            </li>
            <notes class="nc">
              <p>
                <strong>Having trouble with gatsby</strong> new? If you had
                trouble globally installing gatsby-cli in Part 0, you can also
                create a new site by running npm init gatsby from the command
                line instead of gatsby new.

                  In the future, you can use these options to tell gatsby new
                  what features you want to add to your site, and gatsby new
                  will automatically configure them for you. It’s a much quicker
                  way to set up new projects. But in this first site, you’ll set
                  things up manually to learn about how Gatsby’s pieces fit
                  together.

                use the arrow and Space keys to select

                then use the arrow and Enter keys to select
                <strong>“Done”</strong>. This tells gatsby new to add a plugin
                called gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud to your site. Don’t worry
                about the details of this just yet. You’ll learn about plugins
                later on in the Tutorial. For now, all you need to know is that
                this plugin will help your site work better when you deploy it
                with Gatsby Cloud.

          <p>
            So far, you’ve generated the code for your site, but what does it
            actually look like in a web browser like Firefox or Google Chrome?
            To find out, you’ll first need to start up your site’s local
            development server.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>development server</strong> is a useful tool for when
            you’re working on your site locally (from your own computer). When
            your development server is running, you can use a web browser to
            interact with your local copy of your site. That way, you can test
            out changes to your code, to make sure they work before you actually
            publish a new version of your site to the internet.
          </p>
          <p>To start up your development server, do the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                In the command line, change into the directory you created for
                your site: ~/Desktop
                <code> cd my-first-gatsby-site </code>
              </p>
              <notes class="nc">
                <p>
                  <strong>Tip </strong> : Whenever you want to run any commands
                  for your site, you need to be in the context for that site.
                  That is, your command line needs to be pointed at the
                  directory where your site’s code lives.
                </p>
              </notes>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                From your site directory, start the development server by
                running the following command: ~/Desktop/my-first-gatsby-site
                <code> gatsby develop </code>
              </p>
              <notes class="nc">
                <p>
                  If you weren’t able to install the Gatsby command line
                  interface globally, you can start your development server
                  using the following command instead:
                  <code>npm run develop</code>
                </p>
              </notes>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                After a few moments, the command line should output a message
                like the following, telling you your development server is ready
                to go!
                <code
                  >You can now view my-first-gatsby-site in the browser. ⠀
                  http://localhost:8000/ <br />

                  and schema ⠀ http://localhost:8000/___graphql
                </code>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Open your favorite web browser and navigate to
                http://localhost:8000.
              </p>
              <img src="img/localhost-new-site.png" alt="" />
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>And there it is: your very first Gatsby site! 🎉</p>
          <p>
            You’ll be able to visit the site locally at http://localhost:8000/
            for as long as your development server is running. (That’s the
            process you started by running the gatsby develop command.) To stop
            running that process (or to “stop running the development server”),
            go back to your terminal window, hold down the “control” key, and
            then hit “c” (ctrl-c). To start it again, run gatsby develop again!
          </p>
          <notes class="nc">
            <p>
              <strong>Note </strong> : If you are using VM setup like vagrant
              and/or would like to listen on your local IP address, run gatsby
              develop --host=0.0.0.0. Now, the development server listens on
              both http://localhost and your local IP.

            GitHub is a website that many developers use to back up and share
            their code online. By uploading your code to GitHub, you’ll be able
            to work on the same codebase from multiple computers. You’ll also be
            able to use Gatsby Cloud to build and host your site.
          </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Each codebase on GitHub is stored in its own
                <strong>repository</strong> (also called a “repo”, for short).
                To create a new repository for your blog, click the plus icon in
                the top-right corner of the navigation bar. Select “New
                repository”.

            <li>
              <p>
                When filling out the form for your new repo, you can make it
                public or private. (This only affects the visibility of your
                code on GitHub. Your site will still be visible to everyone once
                you deploy it with Gatsby Cloud.) Leave the initialization
                option checkboxes unchecked.

                To push your existing code from your computer to your new GitHub
                repository, enter the commands below in the command line. Be
                sure to swap out YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME for your actual username
                and YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME with the name you gave your GitHub
                repo (like my-first-gatsby-site).

              <strong>Using GitHub for the first time?</strong>
              <p>
                If you get an error about permissions when you try to push your
                code to GitHub for the first time, you might need to set up an
                SSH key for your GitHub account. This lets GitHub know that your
                computer has permission to push code changes to your remote
                repos.
              </p>
              <p>
                For instructions on how to set up an SSH key, follow GitHub’s
                guide:
                <a

            Now you have a copy of your code saved on GitHub’s servers. In the
            next step, you’ll connect your Gatsby Cloud account to the GitHub
            repo you just created.

          <p>
            Gatsby Cloud is an infrastructure platform that is specifically
            optimized for building, deploying, and hosting Gatsby sites. Once
            you connect your Gatsby Cloud account to your GitHub repository,
            Gatsby Cloud will build your site and make it available for others
            on the internet to see.
          </p>
          <p>
            To connect your code on GitHub to your Gatsby Cloud account, do the
            following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Go to your
                <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/dashboard/"
                  >Gatsby Cloud Dashboard.</a
                >
                Click on the <strong>“Add a site”</strong> button.
              </p>
              <img
                src="img/01-create-a-site-button.png"
                alt="create site button img"
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The next few steps will help you add your site to Gatsby Cloud.
                First, select
                <strong>“Import from a Git repository”</strong> and click the
                <strong>“Next”</strong> button at the bottom of the page.
              </p>
              <img

                alt="import a git repo img"
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Select <strong>GitHub</strong> as the Git provider.</p>
              <img
                src="img/03-select-a-git-provider.png"
                alt="select a git provider img"
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If this is your first time connecting GitHub to Gatsby Cloud,
                you’ll need to give Gatsby Cloud permission to access your
                GitHub account. When asked,<strong
                  >“Where should we host this new project?”</strong
                >
                click the <strong>“Select destination”</strong> button.
              </p>
              <img
                src="img/04-select-destination.png"
                alt="select destination img"
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A new browser window should open, where GitHub will ask you
                whether you want to give Gatsby Cloud permission to your GitHub
                repositories. You can choose whether to give Gatsby Cloud access
                to all of your GitHub repositories or to only the repository you
                created (my-first-gatsby-site). Then click “Install”.
              </p>
              <img src="img/05-github-gatsby-cloud-permissions.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now, when you go back to the Gatsby Cloud window, the
                <strong>“Select a Repository”</strong> dropdown should list your
                GitHub repository. Select it.
              </p>
              <img src="img/06-select-repository.png" alt="select repo img" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Once you select your repo, a few more input fields will show up.
                These let you tell Gatsby Cloud where to look in your GitHub
                repo for your Gatsby site. You can also change what Gatsby Cloud
                will name your site.
                <strong>Leave the default settings</strong> and click the
                <strong>“Next”</strong> button.
              </p>
              <img src="img/07-add-site-details.png" alt="add details img" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Gatsby Cloud will ask you if you want to add any optional
                integrations to your site. For future projects, this might be
                useful if you want to use a CMS. But for now, click the
                <strong>“Skip this step”</strong> button.
              </p>
              <img
                src="img/08-optional-integrations.png"
                alt="optional integrations img"
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Gatsby Cloud will also ask if you want to add any environment
                variables. Skip this section, and click the
                <strong>“Create site”</strong> button.
              </p>
              <img src="img/09-setup.png" alt="setup img" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now that your site has been created, you’ll be taken to a site
                dashboard where you can see the status of your builds. Gatsby
                Cloud should start building your site automatically. You’ll see
                a link to your new site, which is automatically hosted on Gatsby
                Cloud. You can share this link with anyone, and they’ll be able
                to see your site online!
              </p>
              <img src="img/10-site-page.png" alt="site page img" />
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>You did it! Your Gatsby site is now online! 👏</p>
          <p>
            Every time you push a new change to the main branch of your GitHub
            repo, Gatsby Cloud will see the changes and automatically start a
            build for the new version of your site.

              <strong>Tip:</strong> There will be a unique URL for each build
              (like
              https://build-49535320-b3ae-4761-bbeb-f8f7fa07e0fc.gtsb.io/), and
              a URL that always has the latest build (like
              my-first-gatsby-site-main.gatsbyjs.io). You’ll mostly want to
              share the human-readable URL, so that people can always see the
              most up-to-date version of your site. But in some cases (like when
              you’re trying to debug a specific build of your site) it can be
              helpful to use the unique build URL.

            In this section, you learned how to create a new Gatsby site and
            deploy it online using Gatsby Cloud. As a quick review, here’s the
            diagram outlining the process:

            <p>
              First, you write the code for your Gatsby site from your computer.
              When you’re ready to make your changes live on the internet, you
              go through the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                You push your changes from your computer to a remote repository
                on GitHub. GitHub is an online platform for storing code for
                your projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gatsby Cloud watches your GitHub repository for changes. When it
                sees your new changes, Gatsby Cloud builds your site from your
                code on GitHub.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gatsby Cloud hosts the finished version of your site at a unique
                URL, which users can use to access the latest version of your
                site.
              </li>
